WallStreetPulse page
WallStreetPulse is an open-source project that aims at analyzing and illustrating trends within the r/WallStreetBets online community. This subreddit is a hub for stock and option trading discussions. WallStreetPulse will use natural language processing tools, such as GPT API or Llama 2, to extract insights from subreddit posts and comments. It will use SQL or other database tools to handle data from the Reddit API or web crawler programs. The project's goal is to provide a tool for those interested in the impact of r/WallStreetBets on the financial market. The student's job includes developing and testing the Reddit API or web crawler programs and the language models. The student will also design and implement the user interface of the project.
